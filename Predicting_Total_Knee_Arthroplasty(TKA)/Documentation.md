# Predictig Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Using Demographic Features
## Background
Pre-operative planning is an important process in a surgeon’s routine. Predicting knee implants dimensions is essential during total knee replacement(TKA) surgery in that it reduces the number of implants needed in the operating room at a time which reduced sterilization costs. Extra large or extra small implants that may not be available may be ordered prior to an operation. Correct prediction also reduces the number of size trials in intra_operative trial which reduce surgical duration and increase efficiency. Correct component sizing may decrease pain and need for revision leading to improved patient care.
## Problem Statement
Successful surgeries are key to ensuring patients’ smooth recovery process by minimizing chances of repeat surgeries thus giving patients a quick recovery time. Accurate prediction of implant size using less invasive methods is crucial in the pre-operation process of every surgeon. The ability to use a patient’s physical features to correctly predict component sizes in TKA is a breakthrough in ensuring efficient patient care. This study seeks to use gender, weight, height, and BMI in predicting implant size in TKA.
## Objective
- Develop a prediction model to predict femoral and tibial component size using gender, height and weight.
### Specific objectives
- Determine the relationship between implant size and demographic features.
- Develop a prediction model using machine learning techniques.
- Test the accuracy of the resultant model using test data.
## Reseach questions
- Is there a relationship between implant sizes and gender, height, and weight?
- Can we accurately predict Tibia and Femur using machine learning techniques?
